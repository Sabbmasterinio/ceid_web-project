An anti-covid19 app

Using mostly php 
I built an app that a user can:
- create an account and login to the app
- watch the live location on map 
- inspect which shop or marketplace (from the uploaded data named as poi) is crowded or not
    markers with color applied on map (green is safe , orange is not so safe, red is not safe at all)
- apply a visit on a specific poi
- insert the date of covid infection
- see if a positive user was at the same place as you
- update profile and see personal data

an admin can:
- inspect data and stats of the app
- upload new pois to database
- delete certain poi or delete all data
