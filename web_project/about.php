        This is an app for people who are concerned for their safety
        <br>
        You can use it to see how crowded are the places you want to visit and also to be aware if u were
        in contact at a public place with a covid19 impact
        <br>
        As covid-19 expands, we have to be more aware to our surroundings.

        You can inform other people when you were infected with the virus and also 
        you can see when other people where infected. So you can easily calculate
        if you were at the same place with a covid impact.
        <br>
